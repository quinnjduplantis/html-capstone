    <p>Gaming, and particularly competitive gaming (esports) has been one of my biggest passions
        my entire life! I love to compete in various games at various levels, be it fighting games,
        first person shooting games, or even MMOs! I helped start up my alma mater's esports organization
        and it was the fastest growing organization on campus, going from 10 members to over 400+
        in a single semester! I had the opportunity to travel with the team to a couple 
        LAN events, one being local, but one being in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania!
